                <p1>Finca La Primavera is taking extra steps beyond organic production to also become verified Bird Friendly. Representatives from the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Institute in Washington, DC, who manage the certification’s regulations, visited the farm to give recommendations. They saw La Primavera as a prime example of ecosystem restoration. La Primavera has planted more than one thousand trees of various native species to act as both shade for the coffee and habitats for birds and small mammals.
                </p1> 
                <p2>Francisco describes La Primavera’s philosophy through the farm’s motto: sustainable, fair, and positive. “Sustainable because of our work with the natural environment and being Rainforest Alliance certified, for our farm’s biodiversity and the natural reserve we have, for farming organically, including raising bees to promote pollination.</p2>

                <p>A movement has taken hold in recent years to bring sustainability to the forefront of the coffee industry. It has always been Vournas Coffee Trading’s goal not only to provide amazing specialty coffee and enrich the lives of the farmers that provide it to us, but to protect this amazing world in which we live in. Economic and social sustainability go hand in hand with environmental sustainability. Thus we work with growers that use sustainable practices that minimize any negative impact growing and processing coffee may have on the environment. We also emphasize relationships with nonprofit organizations whose missions are to improve the health and economic lives of the farmers and their families.
